# typetest
A typing application based off of MonkeyType. Written using React + TypeScript (functional components).

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Goggwell/typetest.git ./
yarn
```

Feel free to use npm instead, or to change the directory.

## To-Do
- Figure out how to properly export json
- Optimize array handling (also make words infinite so fast typers don't end up with a blank screen)
- Fix components that aren't working (currently: Header.tsx, Test.tsx)
